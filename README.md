In this game you play as a plant that needs water and light. You had an easy life when Grandma was taking care of you but since she died recently you have to get your water on your own. Also the sun is running away for some reason so you'll need to catch up with him or else you will die, unless you play in easy mode. 
The gameplay is quit simple : left to dance to the left and right to dance to the right. Yes a plant can dance. Also if you press space your head will fly, try it to go further. 

To recap :

	FLOWER MODE

- left arrow: 	lean to the left
- right arrow: 	lean to the right
- space bar:	eject sprout


	SPROUT MODE

- left arrow:	rotate counter clockwise
- right arrow:	rotate clockwise
- space bar: 	burst

Run to the right of the screen and try to get as many water and pollen on your way. See what happens !
